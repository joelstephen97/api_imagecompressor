API to compress image and automatically download it

This program is a small snippet I am working on.
It uses the https://resmush.it/api to compress and image automatically and downloads it from the link using the urllib library into your CWD. 

It is still a work in progress for now, I am working one few aspects,
1. To get it to working for uploading images.
2. I seem to have a problem in my IDLE with entering the link. (It takes me to the website, I will fix this soon X_X)

I am always open to suggestions.
